# Electric Flight Data Analysis & Test Logging Framework

## Background
This repository is based on hands-on experience analyzing raw electric aircraft flight data
using Python. Variables include flight speed, altitude, battery voltage/current, SOC,
and wind-related parameters.

Regression analysis identified wind as the most influential factor affecting
electric aircraft performance, leading to operational strategy and data management insights.

## Purpose
- Analyze electric aircraft flight data using Python
- Identify key performance drivers via regression and correlation analysis
- Provide a reusable framework for test logging and documentation

## Repository Structure
- docs/: project background, meeting minutes, test design
- data/: data schema and descriptions (no raw data)
- src/: reusable analysis and logging code
- notebooks/: exploratory analysis and interpretation
- examples/: example logs and reports
