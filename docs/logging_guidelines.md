# Test Logging Guidelines

## Objective
To ensure test results and logs are recorded consistently and can be reused
for analysis and issue tracking.

## Daily Test Log
Each test day should record:
- Test date
- Test objective
- Environment conditions
- Key observations
- Issues encountered

## Issue Tracking
Recurring issues should be logged with:
- Issue description
- Frequency
- Suspected cause
- Temporary workaround
